## CodeClub 2020 December

Approach:

- In class, we'll use an **online tool** called [repl.it](https://repl.it/) to write, share and execute Python code. This is in order to avoid wasting time with installing Python on your system. Later on, you can install it on your computer, but first of all, let's focus on the basics of actual programming.

**Main** course content is on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@SamuBalogh).

**Additional** course content:

- [RealPython articles](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/)
- [Codewars exercises](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/python?q=&r[]=-8&beta=false)
- [Python for you and me](http://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
- [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
- [Python on Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)
